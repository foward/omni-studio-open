## 2026-05-20 - OS Command Injection in macOS Notification Helpers
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled strings passed into `execAsync` with shell template literals (`osascript -e 'display notification "${safeMsg}"...'`) allowed command injection via single quotes.
**Learning:** Sanitizing double quotes and backslashes is insufficient when single-quoted string arguments are parsed by `/bin/sh`.
**Prevention:** Avoid shell invocation entirely by using `execFile`/`execFileAsync` with argument arrays, and safely escape AppleScript string literals with `JSON.stringify()`.
